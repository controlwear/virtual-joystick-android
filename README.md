# virtual-joystick-android

**v1.10.1** _(New version - [support custom images](#image), button & background size, limited direction, normalized coordinate, alpha border)_

_I created this very simple library as a learning process and I have been inspired by this project [JoystickView](https://github.com/zerokol/JoystickView) (the author is a genius!)_

This library provides a very simple and **ready-to-use** custom view which emulates a joystick for Android.

### Gist
Here is a very simple snippets to use it. Just set the `onMoveListener` to retrieve its angle and strength.

```java
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

    ...

    JoystickView joystick = (JoystickView) findViewById(R.id.joystickView);
    joystick.setOnMoveListener(new JoystickView.OnMoveListener() {
        @Override
        public void onMove(int angle, int strength) {
            // do whatever you want
        }
    });
}
```
The **angle** follow the rules of a simple **counter-clock** protractor. The **strength is percentage** of how far the button is **from the center to the border**.

By default the **refresh rate** to get the data is **20/sec (every 50ms)**. If you want more or less just set the listener with one more parameters to set the refresh rate in milliseconds.
```java
joystick.setOnMoveListener(new JoystickView.OnMoveListener() { ... }, 17); // around 60/sec
```

### Attributes

You can customize the joystick according to these attributes `JV_buttonImage`, `JV_buttonColor`, `JV_buttonSizeRatio`, `JV_borderColor`, `JV_borderAlpha`, `JV_borderWidth`, `JV_backgroundColor`, `JV_backgroundSizeRatio`, `JV_fixedCenter`, `JV_autoReCenterButton`, `JV_buttonStickToBorder`, `JV_enabled` and `JV_buttonDirection`

If you specified `JV_buttonImage` you don't need `JV_buttonColor`

Here is an example for your layout resources:
```xml
<io.github.controlwear.virtual.joystick.android.JoystickView
    xmlns:custom="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    custom:JV_buttonColor="#FF6E40"
    custom:JV_buttonSizeRatio="15%"
    custom:JV_borderColor="#00796B"
    custom:JV_backgroundColor="#009688"
    custom:JV_borderWidth="4dp"
    custom:JV_fixedCenter="false"/>
```
#### Image
If you want a more customized joystick, you can use `JV_buttonImage` and the regular `background` attributes to specify drawables. The images will be automatically resized.

```xml
<io.github.controlwear.virtual.joystick.android.JoystickView
    xmlns:custom="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:background="@drawable/joystick_base_blue"
    custom:JV_buttonImage="@drawable/ball_pink"/>
```

![Alt text](/misc/android-virtual-joystick-custom-image.png?raw=true "Left joystick with custom image")

#### SizeRatio
We can change the default size of the button and background.
The size is calculated as a percentage of the total width/height.

By default, the button is 25% (0.25) and the background 75% (0.25), as the first screenshot above.

If the total (background + button) is above 1.0, the button will probably be a bit cut when on the border.

```xml
<...
    custom:JV_buttonSizeRatio="50%"
    custom:JV_backgroundSizeRatio="10%"/>

```

```java
joystick.setBackgroundSizeRatio(0.5);
joystick.setButtonSizeRatio(0.1);
```

_The background size is not working for a custom picture._

#### FixedCenter or Not? (and auto re-center)
If you don’t set up this parameter, it will be FixedCenter by default, which is the regular behavior.

However, sometimes, it is convenient to have an auto-defined center which will be defined each time you touch down the screen with your finger (center position will be limited inside the JoystickView’s width/height).
As every parameter you can set it up in xml (as above) or in Java:
```java
joystick.setFixedCenter(false); // set up auto-define center
```

UnfixedCenter (set to false) is particularly convenient when the user can’t (or doesn’t want to) see the screen (e.g. a drone's controller).

We can also remove the automatically re-centered button, just set it to false.
```java
joystick.setAutoReCenterButton(false);
```
_(The behavior is a bit weird if we set remove both the FixedCenter and the AutoReCenter.)_

#### Enabled
By default the joystick is enabled (set to True), but you can disable it either in xml or Java. Then, the button will stop moving and `onMove()` won’t be called anymore.
```java
joystick.setEnabled(false); // disabled the joystick
joystick.isEnabled(); // return enabled state
```

#### ButtonDirection
By default the button can move in both direction X,Y (regular behavior), but we can limit the movement through one axe horizontal or vertical.
```xml
<...
    custom:JV_buttonDirection="horizontal"/>
```
In the layout file (xml), this option can be set to `horizontal`, `vertical` or `both`.

We can also set this option in the Java file by setting an integer value:
- any negative value (e.g. -1) for the horizontal axe
- any positive value (e.g. 1) for the vertical axe
- zero (0) for both (which is the default option)

```java
joystick.setButtonDirection(1); // vertical
```

### Wearable
If you use this library in Wearable app, you will probably disable the Swipe-To-Dismiss Gesture and implement the Long Press to Dismiss Pattern, which could be a problem for a Joystick Pattern (because we usually let the user touch the joystick as long as she/he wants), in that case you can set another convenient listener: `OnMultipleLongPressListener` which will be invoked only with multiple pointers (at least two fingers) instead of one.
```java
joystick.setOnMultiLongPressListener(new JoystickView.OnMultipleLongPressListener() {
    @Override
    public void onMultipleLongPress() {
        ... // eg. mDismissOverlay.show();
    }
});
```
Or better, if you just want a simple Joystick (and few other cool stuff) as a controller for your mobile app you can use the following related project ;)
